Relays your chat from inside FFXIV to one or more Discord channels of your choosing.

You can set the same chat messages to go to multiple channels.

Does not relay chat from Discord to FFXIV. (There are several issues with this, as Discord allows a lot of features that would not map to chat in FFXIV)
